Prerequisites

* `Python`_ 2.7. Other versions may be ok but are not part of the test suite at

As a library

In most cases, you will use `pydocusign` as a dependency of another project.
In such a case, you should add ``pydocusign`` in your main project's
requirements. Typically in :file:`setup.py`:

.. code:: python

   from setuptools import setup

   setup(
       install_requires=[
           'pydocusign',
           #...
       ]
       # ...
   )

Then when you install your main project with your favorite package manager
(like `pip`_), `pydocusign` will automatically be installed.

You can install `pydocusign` with your favorite Python package manager.
As an example with `pip`_:
