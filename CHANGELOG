=========

This document describes changes between each past release. For information
about future releases, check `milestones`_ and :doc:`/about/vision`.


0.8 (unreleased)
----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.7 (2014-10-16)
----------------

Testing tools around notification callbacks.

- Features #14 and #16 - ``pydocusign.test`` provides utilities to test
  notification callbacks: generate body content for notification requests,
  post fake notification requests to a custom URL.

- Added pseudo-constants in ``pydocusign.models``, so that you can use them
  instead of strings. As an example, you'd better use
  ``pydocusign.models.ENVELOPE_STATUS_SENT`` instead of ``"Sent"``.

  Removed ``STATUS_SENT`` and ``STATUS_DRAFT`` from ``Envelope`` model.


0.6 (2014-10-08)
----------------

Improvements around event notifications.

- Feature #15 - On envelope creation, register callback URL for recipient
  events.

- Feature #17 - ``pydocusign.DocuSignCallbackParser`` can extract data from
  DocuSign's event notification callbacks.


0.5 (2014-09-26)
----------------

Minor feature around document download.

- Feature #12: DocuSignClient.get_envelope_document() returns a file-like
  object with a close() method.


0.4 (2014-09-17)
----------------

Feature: download envelope's documents.

- Feature #10 - Introduced methods for client and envelope instances to get the
  list of envelope's documents, and download documents.


0.3 (2014-09-12)
----------------

Minor API simplification.

- Feature #7 - Since most methods of ``DocuSignClient`` require ``account_url``
  attribute, they can initialize it automatically with a call to
  ``login_information()``.

- Bug #6 - Added "URL" and "license" fields to Python package metadata (were
  missing).


0.2 (2014-09-05)
----------------

Integrate more DocuSign features.

- Feature #1 - Envelopes can be created with ``eventNotification`` argument,
  which allows to setup API callbacks on signature updates.

- Feature #3 - Added support for "approve tabs", which allow signer to sign a
  document without adding visible text/graphic to the document.

- Feature #5 - DocuSignClient.login_information raises DocuSignException and
  emits logs on error.


0.1 (2014-07-30)
----------------

Initial release.

- Introduced ``DocuSignClient`` client and models. Initial features around
  embedded signing workflow:

  * login
  * create envelope
  * get envelope's recipients (read envelope)
  * post recipient view (get embedded signing URL)
